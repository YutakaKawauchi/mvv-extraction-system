- **Persistent Storage**: IndexedDB-based log storage with search and filtering
- **Debug Interface**: JSON viewer with formatted display and export capabilities
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing times, token counts, costs, and model information
- **Data Schema**:
  ```typescript
  interface ApiRequestLog {
    id: string;
    endpoint: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    request: object;
    response: object;
    processingTime: number;
    model: string;
    tokens: number;
    cost: number;
    success: boolean;
  }
  ```

### Phase ε: Async Verification & Canvas Editing (Week 3-4)

#### Phase ε.1: Background Verification API
**Priority**: Medium | **Complexity**: High | **Timeline**: 5-7 days
- **Async Processing**: `verify-business-idea-background.js` with job queue system
- **Status Polling**: Real-time progress updates with WebSocket-like polling
- **Timeout Resolution**: Eliminate current 30s timeout limitations
- **Error Recovery**: Robust retry mechanisms and partial result handling
- **Architecture**:
  ```
  Client → Background API → Job Queue → Status Check → Result Delivery
  ```

#### Phase ε.2: Lean Canvas Editor System
**Priority**: Medium | **Complexity**: Medium | **Timeline**: 4-5 days
- **Inline Editing**: Direct canvas modification with real-time validation
- **Version Control**: Change tracking with diff visualization
- **Auto-Save Integration**: Seamless integration with Phase δ.1
- **AI Suggestion Integration**: Direct application of verification recommendations
- **Export Options**: Multiple format exports (PDF, PNG, Excel integration)

### Phase ζ: Advanced Management & Analytics (Week 5-6)

#### Phase ζ.1: Version Management System
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: High | **Timeline**: 7-10 days
- **Idea Evolution Tracking**: Complete version history with branching support
- **Change Visualization**: Timeline view with diff comparisons
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Easy reversion to previous versions
- **Collaboration Features**: Notes, comments, and change explanations
- **Merge Functionality**: Combining insights from multiple verification rounds

#### Phase ζ.2: Advanced Analytics Dashboard
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: Medium | **Timeline**: 3-4 days
- **Cross-Company Analysis**: Idea similarity and trend identification
- **Performance Metrics**: Success rate tracking and improvement suggestions
- **Cost Analytics**: Detailed API usage and optimization recommendations
- **Export Capabilities**: Comprehensive reporting with data visualization

### Phase 4: AI-Powered Insights and Recommendations (Q2-Q3 2025)

#### Planned Features
1. **Advanced AI Enhancement**: GPT-4o powered deep analysis
2. **Predictive Market Analysis**: Trend prediction and competitive intelligence
3. **Multi-language Support**: International company analysis capabilities
4. **Enterprise Integration**: SSO, custom branding, advanced security features

#### Cost Optimization Strategy
- **Smart Caching**: Current 3-tier system achieving 90%+ cost reduction
- **Tiered Usage**: Freemium model with professional tiers
- **Target Cost**: <$0.02/user/month operational cost (achieved via caching)

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach
- **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds upon previous implementations
- **Backward Compatibility**: All new features maintain existing functionality
- **Performance First**: Optimization for large datasets and concurrent users

- **Documentation Updates**: Real-time documentation maintenance
- **User Feedback Integration**: Regular user testing and feedback incorporation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of system performance metrics

### Deployment Strategy
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout with ability to disable problematic features
- **A/B Testing**: User experience optimization through controlled testing
- **Monitoring**: Real-time error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Rollback Plans**: Quick reversion capabilities for all new features

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- API response time < 3 seconds for 95% of requests
- System uptime > 99.9%
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Cost per operation < $0.02

### Business Metrics
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Feature adoption rate > 80%
- API cost reduction > 90% through caching
- Processing capacity > 100 companies/hour

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
